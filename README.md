Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using PySpark


Project Brief


The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model using PySpark that accurately predicts customer churn in a telecom company. By leveraging the distributed computing capabilities of PySpark, we can efficiently handle large volumes of data and build a model that achieves a minimum accuracy of 0.8. The project aims to help the telecom company identify customers who are likely to churn and implement proactive measures to retain them, thereby reducing customer attrition and improving business performance.


Background Information


Customer churn poses a significant challenge in the telecom industry. Identifying customers who are at risk of leaving is crucial for implementing targeted retention strategies. By utilizing PySpark, we can leverage its distributed computing capabilities to handle large-scale datasets efficiently and build an accurate machine learning model for churn prediction.


Problem Statement


The main goal of this project is to develop a PySpark-based machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn in a telecom company. The model should achieve a minimum accuracy of 0.8, enabling the company to proactively identify and retain customers at risk of leaving. By effectively predicting churn, the company can implement targeted retention strategies, reduce customer attrition, and improve overall business performance.


Guidelines


Dataset: 

Obtain a telecom customer dataset that includes relevant features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, service plans, call details, customer complaints, and churn status. The provided dataset can be used as a reference.

Data Preprocessing: Perform necessary preprocessing steps on the dataset using PySpark's DataFrame API. Handle missing values, perform feature scaling, encode categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing sets. Efficient data manipulation techniques should be employed.

Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing dataset that may assist in predicting churn. Consider calculating metrics such as call duration, average monthly spend, customer tenure, or customer satisfaction scores.

Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for churn prediction, taking into account the problem's nature and dataset characteristics. PySpark provides various algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, and support vector machines. Experiment with different models and hyperparameter configurations to achieve the desired accuracy of 0.8.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Determine the model that achieves the desired accuracy and generalizes well on unseen data.

Documentation and Reporting: Maintain clear documentation throughout the project, including details about the dataset, preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation results. Summarize the project findings, challenges faced, and lessons learned in a final report.

By following these guidelines, the project aims to develop an efficient and accurate churn prediction model using PySpark, providing the telecom company with valuable insights to retain customers and improve business performance.
